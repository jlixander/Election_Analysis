# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this project we write a python script to automatically count the ballots for our election results. We use the power of python to bin the data by candidate and county.

### Election-Audit Results
The election results are as follows:
*A total of 369,711 were casted
*County breakdown:
    *Jefferson: 38,855 which represent 10.5%
    *Denver: 306,055 which represent 82.8%
    *Arapahoe: 24,801 which represent 6.7%
    *County with most votes: Denver
*Candidate breakdown:
    *Charles Casper Stockham: 85,213 which represent 23%
    *Diana DeGette: 272,892 which represent 73.8%
    *Raymon Anthony Doane: 11,606 which represent 3.1%

### Election-Audit Summary
It should be noted that this python script can be used for any election at any level. The script can be modified to take in similar data with more candidates and party. It can also be customized to bin data at any geographical scale as long as the data is provided with each ballot cast (i.e.: zip code, neighborhood, state region, etc.).
